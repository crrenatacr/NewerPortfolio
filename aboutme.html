          <p>
            I am an aspiring web development student driven by a strong desire
            to learn and grow in the field. With each project I build, I focus
            on strengthening my understanding of core concepts, refining my
            problem-solving skills, and improving my ability to create
            functional applications. While I have developed a few projects
            throughout my course, I see every challenge as an opportunity to
            deepen my knowledge and enhance my practical experience. What I need
            now is an opportunity to continue learning skills in real-world
            scenarios, and expand my foundation to progress further as a
            developer.
          </p>
          <p>Years ago, I earned a degree in Psychology, driven by a curiosity 
            about human behavior and problem-solving. After graduation, I explored 
            different fields—game design, interior design, and architecture—seeking 
            the right path. Life led me to new responsibilities, including moving to
             Germany and focusing on family, which limited my ability to pursue 
             further studies at the time. However, my determination to grow professionally
              never faded. Now, through a Full Stack Web Development bootcamp, I’ve 
              found the opportunity to shift my career towards a field that challenges
               me intellectually and allows continuous learning. I’m eager 
               grow as a developer.</p>
