            <h2>About the project</h2>
            <p>
              This project is a serverless, progressive web application (PWA)
              with React using a test-driven and behavior-driven development
              (TDD/BDD) technique. The application uses the Google Calendar API
              to fetch upcoming events and presents some charts with event info.
            </p>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Globalgigs is a Progressive Web App (PWA), with a front-end
              developed in React, with offline capabilities and a serverless
              backend. It follows TDD and BDD techniques for unit, integration,
              and end-to-end testing. Users can check upcoming events for a
              specific city. The application uses the Google Calendar API and
              AWS Lambda functions for authentication and authorization via
              Google.
            </p>
            <h3>Purpose & Context</h3>
            <p>
              Globalgigs React Meet App was built as part of my Full Stack Web
              Development course at CareerFoundry to strengthen my learning
              process while following best programming practices.
            </p>

            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>
              The goal of this project was to develop a full-stack application
              that enhances my portfolio while improving my ability to integrate
              and optimize multiple features seamlessly.
            </p>

            <h3>Duration and credits</h3>
            <p>
              This project took longer than expected due to merging and
              debugging challenges, which were addressed with guidance from my
              course mentors. I deeply appreciate their support and teamwork
              throughout the process.

        <h3>Challenges along the way...</h3>
        <p>
          When I set out to build the Meet App, I envisioned an exciting
          full-stack project that would sharpen my skills and elevate my
          portfolio. What I didn’t anticipate was just how challenging it would
          be. The code was dense, complex, and required handling authentication
          and authorization with tokens, which proved to be a constant source of
          frustration. Built with React, the project followed a strict TDD and
          BDD approach, making the testing process feel like an insurmountable
          mountain, once something else, something essential, was still not
          working properly. Despite my efforts, debugging became an endless
          cycle, and I often felt like I was chasing ghosts in my code. I had a
          lot of code and no events being fetched to show my users.

        <h3>...overcoming the Chaos: A Developer’s Journey with Meet App</h3>
        <p>
          At one point, I hit a major roadblock: Google kept blocking access to
          my page, and I couldn’t figure out why. I spent hours, days—even
          weeks—debugging until I reached my breaking point. Exhausted, I
          stepped away from the project, choosing to focus on other developments
          before returning with fresh eyes. When I finally revisited the app, I
          combed through every detail, determined to uncover the root of the
          problem. And there it was—a single duplicated line of code messing up
          the token handling and triggering the access block. After fixing it,
          the authentication system finally worked, and the app came to life as
          intended. This project wasn’t just about building an event app; it was
          a trial by fire that tested my resilience as a developer. In the end,
          I didn’t just complete the Meet App—I conquered it.
